## Project Overview
This repository contains work focusing on cleaning a dataset from an online electronics store based in Melbourne, Australia. The project involves identifying and correcting errors, removing outliers, and imputing missing values from the dataset.A multifaceted data cleaning and correction project involving three distinct datasets, each presenting unique challenges. In the first dataset, missing data was addressed using linear regression-based imputation techniques. The second dataset, plagued by outliers, was effectively processed using a linear regression model. Lastly, the third dataset required the correction of incorrect data by leveraging contextual cues. The project incorporated advanced machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression models, with meticulous hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.![image](https://github.com/MalvikaSud/Datacleaning/assets/104673017/3fe47439-1ca4-4a1d-b338-788c0348b794)


## Data Description
The dataset includes transactional data of orders placed at DigiCo, with details about customer orders, delivery charges, customer reviews, and more. This project works with three main types of data files:
- **Dirty data**: Contains errors that need to be identified and corrected.
- **Outlier data**: Includes data points that are outliers with respect to the delivery charges.
- **Missing data**: Contains missing entries that need to be filled in.
