# Datacleaning
Data cleaning and Machine Learning Project
Successfully completed a multifaceted data cleaning and correction project involving three distinct datasets, each presenting unique challenges. In the first dataset, missing data was addressed using linear regression-based imputation techniques. The second dataset, plagued by outliers, was effectively processed using a linear regression model. Lastly, the third dataset required the correction of incorrect data by leveraging contextual cues. The project incorporated advanced machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression models, with meticulous hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.![image](https://github.com/MalvikaSud/Datacleaning/assets/104673017/3fe47439-1ca4-4a1d-b338-788c0348b794)
